# TranslationTester

This is a simplified version of the TranslationTester, written by Robert Nyman: https://github.com/robnyman/TranslationTester.

This version supports English and Spanish variants. It is the version we finish with in the MDN app localization tutorial and the accompanying screencast. If you want to play along with the tutorial, you can use this version to check that you've successfully followed the tutorial and to fix any problems.
